Intro:

	o Mention the 3 session as individual experiments with the benefit for validating each other.
	o Discuss the machine lead experiment to enforce the respecting of rules.

Session 1:

	o Mixtures created using voices from Youtube.
	o Measured classification accuracy for 1 to 10 speakers. (Fig. 1.1)
	o Volunteers were told that there are maximum 10 speakers.
	o Measured some degree of correlation between listening time and accuracy. (Fig. 1.2)
	
Session 2:

	o Wanted to use other mixtures.
	o Mixtures recorded in a soundproof room.
	o Measured classification accuracy for 1 to 10 speakers. (Fig. 2.1)
	o Volunteers were told that there are maximum 10 speakers.
	o Controlled correlation between listening time and accuracy by fixing times. (Fig. 2.2)
	o Measured the impact of using known voices. (Fig. 2.1)
	
Session 3:

	o Decided that 10 speakers is a huge number. Wanted to compare against machine performance and set target to 4 speakers.
	o Mixtures created from Librispeech database.
	o Volunteers were English speakers. Used ~80 volunteers.
	o Measured the impact of listening time by fixing time-frame lengths to 0.5, 1, 2, 5 seconds. (Fig. 3.1)
	o Measured the impact of listening time by allowing replaying. (Fig. 3.2)
	o Measured the confusion matrix (Fig. 4)
	
Comments and conclusions

	o Showcase table from 2014 experiment. (Table 1)
	o Discuss correlation between sessions.
	o Conclude on listening time.
	o Conclude of using known voices.
	o Conclude on overall human performance.
